# RAG Challenge Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable users to upload multiple document formats (PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF, CSV, TXT)
- Extract and process document content automatically 
- Create searchable embeddings using vector database (Pinecone)
- Provide interactive document exploration and Q&A capabilities
- Build intuitive web interface for document management and chat

### Background Context
This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system addresses the growing need for intelligent document processing and retrieval. Users currently struggle with managing and extracting insights from diverse document formats. The system will leverage modern AI technologies (LlamaIndex, LangChain, OpenAI) to create a seamless document-to-knowledge pipeline, enabling natural language interactions with uploaded content.

### Service Architecture
Monolith with clear separation between document processing, vector operations, and web interface. API-first design enabling future microservices migration if needed.

### Testing Requirements
Unit + Integration testing with focus on document processing pipelines and API endpoints.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use LlamaIndex for document processing and embedding generation
- Integrate LangChain for conversation management
- OpenAI API for embeddings and chat completions
- Pinecone as vector database solution
- Node.js/Express backend with React frontend
- File storage solution (local or cloud) for uploaded documents

## Epic List

### Epic 1: Foundation & Document Upload Infrastructure
Establish project setup, file upload capabilities, and basic document storage with simple web interface.

### Epic 2: Document Processing & Vector Storage
Implement document text extraction, embedding generation, and Pinecone integration for searchable content.

### Epic 3: Interactive Chat & Search Interface  
Build conversational interface allowing users to query and interact with processed document content.

## Epic 1: Foundation & Document Upload Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish foundational project infrastructure and core document upload functionality, delivering a working web application that can accept and store various document formats.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Web Interface
As a developer,
I want a properly configured full-stack project with basic web interface,
so that I have a foundation to build document processing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Node.js/Express backend server running on localhost
2. React frontend with basic routing and components
3. File upload form accepting specified document formats
4. Basic error handling and validation
5. Development environment with hot reloading

### Story 1.2: Document Upload and Storage
As a user,
I want to upload documents through a web interface,
so that I can process them for later retrieval and interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Drag-and-drop file upload supporting PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF, CSV, TXT
2. File validation and size limits (max 10MB)
3. Secure file storage with unique identifiers
4. Upload progress indicators
5. Basic document metadata capture (filename, size, type, upload date)

### Story 1.3: Document Library View
As a user,
I want to see all my uploaded documents in an organized library,
so that I can manage and select documents for interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Grid/list view of uploaded documents with thumbnails/icons
2. Document metadata display (name, type, size, upload date)
3. Search/filter functionality by document name or type
4. Delete document capability
5. Document selection for processing

## Epic 2: Document Processing & Vector Storage

**Goal:** Transform uploaded documents into searchable knowledge by extracting content, generating embeddings, and storing in vector database for retrieval.
