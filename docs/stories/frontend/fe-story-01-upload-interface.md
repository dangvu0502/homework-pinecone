# FE Story 01: Document Upload Interface

## Story Title
Basic Document Upload Interface - Frontend Foundation

## User Story
As a user,
I want to upload documents through a drag-and-drop interface,
So that I can easily add files to the RAG system for processing.

## Story Context
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: New greenfield React + Vite project
- Technology: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, react-dropzone
- Follows pattern: Modern React component patterns with hooks
- Touch points: Will connect to backend upload API (developed in parallel)

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Drag-and-drop file upload supporting PDF, PNG, JPEG, SVG, CSV, TXT
2. File browser fallback with click-to-select functionality
3. File validation (type and 10MB size limit) with user feedback
4. Upload progress indicators for each file
5. File list display with metadata (name, size, type, status)

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Frontend makes POST requests to `/api/documents` endpoint
7. Handles multipart/form-data uploads properly
8. Displays appropriate error messages for failed uploads
9. Updates UI state based on upload status responses

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Component is fully tested with React Testing Library
11. Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
12. Accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
13. Error states provide clear user guidance

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Uses fetch/axios to communicate with Express backend
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow React component composition patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle large files (up to 10MB) without blocking UI

## Implementation Details
```typescript
// Key components to create:
- DocumentUpload.tsx (main upload component)
- FileList.tsx (uploaded files display)
- UploadProgress.tsx (progress indicator)
- useFileUpload.ts (custom hook for upload logic)
```

## API Contract (for parallel backend development)
```typescript
POST /api/documents
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Request:
- file: File (multipart)

Response:
{
  id: string;
  filename: string;
  contentType: string;
  size: number;
  status: 'uploaded' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'error';
  uploadedAt: string;
}
```
